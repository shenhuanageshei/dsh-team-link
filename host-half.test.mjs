 * Settings service stub covering the two namespaces the plugin registers

 * `register` returns the same `get()`/`update(patch)` scope shape the real
 * `settings` service does, so the policy store (and the watchdog list it now
 * carries) is exercised through its real settings path, not the memory fallback.
 * `seed` pre-fills a namespace's data at register time (the state a provider
 * would have loaded from disk), which is how U9 gives the rename migration
 * something to migrate without hand-writing a settings file.
 *
 * `F1` (`settingsRegisterThrows`) models a provider that IS active but refuses
 * `register` — the divergence-audit path where the store can never attach and
 * every lazy retry re-enters the catch. `legacyRegisterThrows` keeps the current
 * namespace working and refuses only `session-link-pro`, the one-line clause of
 * 评审 #4 (an unavailable legacy namespace must say so). `legacyGetThrows` is the
 * other half of that story (评审 round-2 🔵 #3): the legacy namespace registers
 * fine but cannot be READ, which is the branch that used to return with no log
 * at all.
 *
 * `markDead()` (评审 round-2 🟡 #1) models a provider that is gone: the scopes it
 * handed out stop serving. No test flips it by hand — the provider is mounted
 * through a real cordis plugin fiber (see `provideSettingsFiber`) and the fiber's

// U19 红线回归（§10.3 / 演练 8 的准确判据）+ G2 并发纪律（§10.2.6）
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// U19 的四条不是「再跑一遍既有断言」，而是**把红线的判据本身钉成断言**：
//   1) 本轮新增代码不往会话日志写任何自定义事件类型；
//   2) 投递消息的 `source` 仍恰三成员；
//   3) 模块级 `inject` 仍 4 项；
//   4) 既有 schema 与投递双门零改动。
//
// L1 的判据（自选，理由写在这里；差异审计修复轮 🔵-1 把措辞改成诚实版，断言一字未改）：
// **源码级「本模块自己不动日历」+ 运行时「状态只落既有出口」双证据**。措辞的三处更正：
//   ① 插件对会话**确有**写入面——`ctx.agents.create`（本文件的 create 桩即是它的形状）与
//      `agent.followup`；所以断言锁的是「本模块**自己**没有 append/emit 面」，不是「插件不写会话」；
//   ② `ctx.*` 全表的会话接触是 `ctx.sessionQuery` 的**四个读**方法
//      （`listSessions` / `readSession` / `readSurface` / `readTitleSnapshots`——此前写作三个，漏了
//      第一个），它们**都是读**；
//   ③ 结论仍成立，但理由不是「静态正则证明得了这一点」——正则**证明不了**上游那两条路径用的是什么
//      事件类型。红线之所以不破，是因为那两条路径产生的事件类型由**上游定义**（`agents.create` 与
//      `followup` 的形状是上游 API，不是本插件拼的事件信封），本插件无从发明一个新类型；这条断言
//      的作用是**锁**住「本模块不得自己长出写入面」，审计的变异 M6（往模块里放一个日志写入 API →
//      1 红）证明的正是这个锁真的会咬。运行时那条读的是**桩**，结构上观察不到新事件类型——它是
//      旁证（路径确实只经 settings + create + followup），不是新类型的判据。
// The host module is read from the test file's OWN location (`import.meta.url`),
// not from `import.meta.resolve("./lib/index.js")` — the latter resolves against
